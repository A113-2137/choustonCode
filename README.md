This file contains the TeleOp code for FTC 11230 ElektraKatz for Velocity Vortex competition. The robot uses the TileRunner BD base with team built accessories attached to it. The drive system consists of four AndyMark NeveRest 60 motors (2 left, 2 right). The lift is driven by 1 AndyMark NeveRest 40 motor. The motors are defined as follows:
  leftMotor1   = "left motor1"
  leftMotor2   = "left motor2"
  rightMotor1  = "right motor1"
  rightMotor2  = "right motor2"
  upMotor      = "up motor"
  
This OpMode started with the FIRST example "TemplateOpMode_Linear". Team member Conlan Houston modified the Template code to create this TeleOp OpMode.

Letter from Conlan Houston:
  This code holds a very near and dear place in my heart.
It was the last code I made for the ElektraKatz as I was in 8th grade at the time and was moving on to high school. This code reflects the best year I've hade in robotics and I am truely greatful to all the mentors and students who've helped me along.
